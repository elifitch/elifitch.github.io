Everyone should learn to code.  Everybody knows it. You know it, I know it, the [president](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/09/don-t-just-play-your-phone-program-it) knows it.  The economy is shifting and the job market along with it, with developers more in demand than ever, you and your children will be left behind if you cannot code.  Start them early, perhaps with this [book on ruby for kids](http://www.helloruby.com/).  This isn't the first time innovation has forced wholesale change in the american workforce.  <BREAK> I found the following news clipping from the 1870s.

<p style="font-size: 100%; margin: 20px;">Everyone should learn to build trains.  The economy is shifting, and the job market along with it, with trains more in demand than ever, you and your children will be left behind if you cannot construct at least a simple steam engine.  Start them early, perhaps with a book on traingineering, or in your friendly neighborhood sweatshop.</p>

Obviously this is a farce to illustrate my point, and no, not <b>everyone</b> has to learn to code.  Innovation has pushed, even revolutionized the economy many times before, and every time a relatively small segment of the workforce is dedicated to pushing that innovation.  When the automobile began to revolutionize the economy in the last century, was there similar pressure to teach all our children to build cars?

It is beyond obvious that technology is becoming ever more important, and it seems sometimes like a predatory element, disrupting and destroying more traditional businesses.  As Marc Andreessen once [wrote](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html), "software is eating the world".  Learn to code, or be left behind.  [Program or Be Programmed](http://www.rushkoff.com/program-or-be-programmed/).

I for one believe this anxiety is misplaced.  The future is not coming to get us if we don't learn how to code, and we won't be left behind as a nation if we don't create more developers.  It's far more important to learn how to work with technology, conceptualize tech based solutions to problems, and skills like organization, persistence, and risk management.  After all, just learning to code is far from enough.  Brilliantly put by [Kirsten Winkler](http://www.kirstenwinkler.com/spoiler-just-knowing-how-to-code-wont-get-kids-anywhere/): "They are not just code monkeys...People who get the high paid jobs have many more skills than typing 'if then else' phrases. They are foremost creative and can solve problems on their own...Just learning to code won’t get you there."  Teaching more people to code is not a magic bullet for fixing our economic problems, erasing poverty, or keeping up with the geopolitical Joneses.

<h3>Broadcasting from within the echochamber</h3>

From within the tech community, it sometimes seems as if the driving force of this movement to create more coders is motivated by an attutude of ["Code for Code's Sake"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_for_art's_sake).  Because coding is fun to us and there's a high demand for the skill, why shouldn't everyone do it?  Is having more software developers inherently good?  I think many coders would answer that with an emphatic 'yes', but I'm not so sure.

It seems arrogant to believe that everyone should aspire to join the developer ranks, and I know several non-coders in tech who feel unfair pressure to code.  I have seen several developers simply dismiss desigeners who can't code as dinosaurs.  This is the easy way out.  It's easy to casually brush off non-technical people, but in doing that, we alienate ourselves from a weallth of knowledge, expertise, and talent.  The desire for uibiquitous code hurts more than it helps.

Rather than grasping at the "ideal" of a world where everyone codes, and the associated pressure on non-technical people that they <b>should</b> code, I think that expanding code literacy is a great step.

<h3>Public Education is the Key</h3>

Just because creating more coders isn't the imperitive it is so often presented to be, does <b>not</b> mean we should not emphasize computer science in school.  Dramatically increasing investment in general education, not just programming, in our public schools would be tremendous.  It is disappointing then that I observe the discussion of increasing knowledge of code as being rather separate from discussions improving our public education system and the challenges therein.  It would be heartening to see advocates of computer science ubiquity act more broadly on the behalf of our public schools.

<blockquote>
Improving our public schools is far from the path of least resistance, though it might have the broadest impact
</blockquote>

I don't see a future where everyone knows 3 programming languages, builds all their own apps, understands big O, algorithms, data structures and spends high school architecting software.  I see a more modest future, where computer science lives alongside high school biology, where basic literacy in programming concepts, if not functional experience in the field, is expected of high school graduates.  Advanced topics will be left for college to handle, just   Just as biology prepares students for careers in the natural sciences, requiring basic computer science would give every kid a better shot at becoming a software engineer, without the expectation that they <b>should</b> choose that path.  Moreover, it would give future engineers a much more level playing field, lowering barriers to entry and creating a more diverse tech community.

Of course, if this is the desired outcome, simply advocating for required coding classes in public schools isn't enough.  Schools will need money to buy computers, and teachers paid well enough to stay in teaching, even with their specialized knowledge.  It will take a tremendous amount of work and campaigning to accomplish even these modest goals.  Just remember when you wish that more people would code, that you aren't just a tech advocate, you're an advocate for public education.




LAURA FEEDBACK: 
Train clipping make sure you say that it's made up

First paragraph "too fast" not setting up the point
Really liked kirstens quote. Its more than just learning to code, you need experience and related knowledge to be effective
don't capitalize "Coding"
In paragraph before "public edu key" using WAYYYY too many "I"s
"disappointing then that I observe" sentence is fucked up
"data structures" spelled wrong

Main thrust: 
We shouldn't approach the issue of needing more developers as an imperative, nor should we assume that people *should* code and that creating more developers is good for its own sake.  Creating more coders wont magically fix anything.  We DO however need to give more people the opportunity to become coders, without the expectation that they *should* become coders.

NOTES:

To me, I see the idea that oh we should create more coders as being a separate discussion entertained by separate people from discussion of general improvement to our public education system. To me they are one and the same, and pursuiing more reasonable goals of code literacy, similar to high school biology, to prepare students for a career in software development, just as biology prepares our students for careers in the natural sciences.
