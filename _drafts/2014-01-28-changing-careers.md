Outline:
With all great journeys, the journey is more important than the destinaton.
With this, the best part is, that this destination means that the journey never ends.
You are what you want to be. Never let anyone, especially yourself, tell you what you are capable of.
Never settle. Work hard to find what makes you happy. It will always pay off.





It was a little over a year ago that I first had a whim to code.  I wish I could recall what got me interested in DC's tech scene to begin with, or what compelled me to sign up for codecademy, but I can't remember.  //It's rather fitting that I can't quite remember, because this post isn't really about coding//  This post won't touch much on how I learned, the tricks I picked up, and how I developed as a coder, although I'm such posts will be coming.  Rather I want to pass on what I learned in a more expansive sense: what I learned about creativity and changing one's path, one's circumstances, and one's self.

After graduating college I found myself, like many (lazy, narcissistic) millenials adrift and without a creative outlet.  I counted myself fortunate to have a job, but like many first, second, and third jobs they weren't particularly interesting, and they didn't inspire me.  **It was really hard to find time for exploring other interess**






It was a little over a year ago that I first had a whim to code.  I wish I could recall what compelled me, or how I found out about codecademy.com, how I found out about DC Tech even, but I can't.  That fact in and of itself is interesting.  Makes it feel like destiny, even if that very notion is more than a little self indulgent.

I recall toying with javascript, and then discarding it.  It took me several weeks to get back into it. Just writing simple HTML and CSS was enough to have the reward of immediately bringing something to life in the browser, even just red and blue blocks.
